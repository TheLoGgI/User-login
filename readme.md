## Learnings
- The PDO method and prepered statements is a necessary use when writing SQL queryies. It is an object oriented  way of making a connection to a database and newer then the mysqli way of doing it. It supports more databases, which also makes it an easy choice. But either methode can do the job. 

- PHP is server side, which means nothing of the php code you write is visiable on the client side and makes it a good opportunity to build a login system. Since is can be more secure that way. I would like to know more about the PHP and MySQL 'qurks', to get a better understanding. Sometimes it seams a bit magical, when assigning and running a function inside of an if-statement.

- I would also like to know if there are any devloper tools for PHP, to better know the state of different variables.
